## Semester 1

A few basic exercises we were assigned during our first semester of classes.
  
  1. [Optionals](https://github.com/BGMP/University/tree/master/semester1/optionals): A few optional assignments we were given.
  2. [Projects](https://github.com/BGMP/University/tree/master/semester1/projects):
      * `frog.c`: A small commandline game where you press enter to roll a dice and advance. It also renders a board.
  3. [Finals](https://github.com/BGMP/University/tree/master/semester1/finals): Some exercises from the final exam we had.
  
## Semester 2

Some more exercises from our second semester, this time with more project assignments.

  1. [Exercises](https://github.com/BGMP/University/tree/master/semester2/exercises): Basic exercises.
  2. [Tests](https://github.com/BGMP/University/tree/master/semester2/tests): A quick exam exercise we had to do.
  3. [Projects](https://github.com/BGMP/University/tree/master/semester2/projects):
       * `cinema.c`: A commandline cinema management tool thingy we had to code. It prints room distributions, and
       can filter from row to row when doing so.
       * `word_search.c`: A word search, where you input the words and it prints out the whole thing in the end.
  
## Semester 3

Nothing much yet, just a diagnosis we were assigned.
    
   1. [Diagnosis](https://github.com/BGMP/University/tree/master/semester3/diagnosis):
       * `diagnosis.c`: The only interesting part of this thing is that includes a function to validate Chilean RUT codes.
       Other than that, just another input registry project.
