## Semester 1

A few basic exercises we were assigned during the first semester of classes.
  
  1. Optionals: A few optional assignments we were given.
  2. Projects:
      * `frog.c`: A small commandline game were you press enter to roll a dice and advance. It also renders a board.
  3. Finals: Some exercises from the final exam we had.
  
## Semester 2

Some more exercises from the second semester, this time with more project assignments.

  1. Exercises: Basic exercises.
  2. Tests: Some quick exam exercise we had to do.
  3. Projects:
       * `cinema.c`: A commandline cinema management tool thingy we had to code. It prints room's distributions, and
       can filter from row to row when doing so.
       * `word_search.c`: A word search, were you input the words and it prints out the whole thing in the end.
  
## Semester 3

Nothing much yet, just a diagnosis we were assigned.
    
   1. Diagnosis:
       * `diagnosis.c`: The only interesting part of this is that it includes a function to validate Chilean RUTs codes.
       Other than that, just another input registry project.
